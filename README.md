TalkBox
-------------

#### Software Development Project

**TalkBox Simulator**
A piece of software that simulates the behaviour of any TalkBox device.
Has a user interface similar to that of the device.
The number of buttons and their functionality is configurable.
Is fully tested to behave as the hardware device.

The current version of TalkBox.jar requires the TalkBoxData folder for all the audio files and configuration.
Hence in order to work properly, *do not move* TalkBox.jar file in different location.

This software requires physical devices such as monitor(for user interface), audio input(to record, eg. mic) and output(to play sound, eg. speaker). System requirements are stated in 'Requirements_Document.pdf' inside of [Documentation][2] folder
